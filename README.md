Port-man research is  portfolio management program. The program uses investors risk profile such as age, appetite for risk, income group
and purpose of investment to analyse and build a portfolio.
The program in it's basic form uses theories of Markowitz and Efficient frontier to optimise the portfolio asset allocation using
sharpe ratio.

**Markowitz Theories:**

1. **Efficient Frontier**: Markowitz Theory introduced the concept of the efficient frontier, which represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected
   return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return. Portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier are considered to be optimal because
   they provide the best possible risk-return trade-off.

3. **Risk and Diversification**: Markowitz emphasized the importance of diversification in reducing risk. By investing in a mix of assets that are not perfectly correlated,
   investors can reduce the overall risk of their portfolio without sacrificing returns. Diversification helps to smooth out the volatility of returns and improve the
   risk-adjusted return of the portfolio.

6. **Portfolio Optimization**: Markowitz Theory introduced the concept of portfolio optimization, which involves selecting the optimal mix of assets to achieve a desired level
   of return while minimizing risk. The optimization process considers the expected returns, volatilities, and correlations of the assets to construct a portfolio that maximizes
   returns for a given level of risk.

8. **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Markowitz Theory is closely related to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which posits that asset prices reflect all available information
   and that it is impossible to consistently outperform the market. MPT helps investors navigate the market by focusing on creating diversified portfolios that aim to maximize
   returns for a given level of risk.
